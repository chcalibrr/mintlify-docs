## Player Authentication

Chatform, the leading AI player support platform, provides a robust and customizable player authentication system. This system ensures that player support tickets are managed securely and efficiently, allowing access to necessary player data to resolve issues effectively.

### Customizing Player Authentication Fields

The player authentication process in Chatform is highly flexible, allowing you to define which fields are required for verifying a player's identity. This customization ensures that the authentication process aligns with your casino's specific requirements and security protocols.

#### Example: Email and CPF Authentication

In this example, we will configure the authentication to require both an email address and a CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas FÃ­sicas, a Brazilian tax identification number) to verify a player's identity.

1. **Define Authentication Fields**:
    - Email
    - CPF

2. **Set Up Authentication in Chatform**:
    - Navigate to the Chatform admin panel.
    - Select "Player Authentication Settings."
    - Add the required fields: Email and CPF.
    - Save the settings.

### Testing the Authentication Response

Once the authentication fields are set up, you can test the connection to ensure it works correctly. This step is crucial to validate that the integration between the casino backoffice platform and Chatform is functioning as expected.

#### Steps to Test the Authentication:

1. **Initiate a Test Ticket**:
    - Create a test player support ticket in Chatform.
    - Enter the required authentication information (Email and CPF).

2. **Send Authentication Request**:
    - Chatform will send the entered information to the casino backoffice platform for verification.

3. **Verify Response**:
    - Check the response from the backoffice platform.
    - If the authentication is successful, the ticket status will be updated to "Authenticated."

### Access to Player Data

Once a ticket is authenticated, Chatform gains access to the player's data. This access is essential for providing context and relevant information to resolve the support ticket efficiently.

#### Benefits of Authenticated Tickets:

- **Secure Data Access**: Only authenticated tickets can access player data, ensuring data security and privacy.
- **Contextual Support**: Support agents have the necessary context to address player issues promptly.
- **Improved Resolution Times**: With immediate access to player information, issues can be resolved more quickly.

### Authentication Expiry

Once a player is authenticated, Chatform will be able to access player information and specific data used for ticket handling and decision-making. It is important to know that for security, authentication expires as soon as the ticket is resolved. When the player reaches out again, they will need to re-authenticate.

### Conclusion

Integrating the casino backoffice platform with Chatform enhances the player support experience by providing a secure and customizable authentication process. By setting up and testing the required authentication fields, you ensure that player support tickets are managed effectively, with access to necessary player data to resolve issues promptly.
