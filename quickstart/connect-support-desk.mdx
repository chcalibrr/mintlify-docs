#### Connecting Zendesk to Chatform
1. **Access the Chatform Integration Settings:** Navigate to the "Channels" section within your Chatform dashboard. Locate the specific integration you wish to configure (e.g., Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk).
2. **Connect your Helpdesk Account:** You will be prompted to enter your Zendesk subdomain. This can usually be found in your helpdesk's URL. For example, if your Zendesk URL is https://d3v-yourcompany.zendesk.com, your subdomain would be **d3v-yourcompany**.
3. **Authorize Chatform Access:** You'll be redirected to your Zendesk login page. Sign in using an account with the necessary permissions to allow Chatform to access your helpdesk data.
4. **Select Channels:** Choose the specific channels within your helpdesk that you want Chatform to interact with. You can easily toggle these channels as needed.
