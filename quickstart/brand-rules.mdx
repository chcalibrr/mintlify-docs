### Why Use Brand Rules?

**Brand rules** are a usefull feature that allows you to customize ticket handling and responses based on the brand the player is contacting you from. This is a widely used feature by our users, and can be incredibly helpful in managing multi-brand support.

#### Different brand Ticket Handling instructions

Setting different ticket handling instructions and actions for each brand provides the ability to tailor how agents handle tickets in a multi-brand environment. You can customize everything to a per-brand basis, from actual handling instructions and available actions to tagging conversations differently.

**Example: Bonus Tickets**

For example, if a player is inquiring about a bonus from Brand A, you might want to offer them an active bonus for that specific brand. However, if they are reaching out from a different brand, Brand B, you might instead inform them that you do not currently offer bonuses for that particular brand.

#### Different brand Knowlage Base source

While the knowledge base data serves primarily as general knowledge rather than direct instructions for handling tickets, it is still possible to set different knowledge bases for each brand. This makes it easy to support multiple brands by providing relevant information for each.
