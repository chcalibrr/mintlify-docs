Chatform empowers you to leverage your existing knowledge base to enhance your player support experience.

Before you begin:

- **Ensure Public Access:** Your knowledge base must be publicly accessible, meaning it should not be restricted behind a login.
- **Standard URL Structure:** Verify that your knowledge base URLs follow the default structure provided by your platform (e.g., Zendesk Guide, Salesforce Knowledge). Custom URLs might lead to broken links within Chatform.
- **Access Chatform's Knowledge Integration:** Within your Chatform dashboard, navigate to the "Knowledge" section, then click on "Add."
- **Connect Your Zendesk Subdomain:** Click "Add Source" and select "Zendesk." Enter your Zendesk subdomain in the "Connect Zendesk Guide" window and click "Connect."
- **Confirmation:** A success message will appear, indicating a successful connection.

#### Integration with Other Knowledge Base Platforms:

If you're using Salesforce Knowledge, you can follow similar integration steps within Chatform.

**Note:** For detailed, platform-specific instructions, contact your Chatform account executive. They can provide tailored guidance to ensure a smooth and successful integration.
