Congratulations on completing the setup process with your CSM! Now it's time to witness the magic of Chatform in action. This guide will walk you through the deployment process, ensuring a smooth and successful experience.

### Testing in a Safe Space

Before unleashing Chatform on your live brand, we highly recommend testing it in a new dedicated Zendesk test brand. This allows you to experience the complete ticket handling process in a controlled environment. It's like giving Chatform a practice run before the real show begins.

<Tip> **Tip:** You only need to conduct this test environment setup once before the initial deployment. After that, you can utilize the Chatform playground test environment for further experimentation</Tip>

### Time to Go Live!

With confidence gained from testing, it's time to let Chatform shine in your live brand! Deploying Chatform marks the beginning of a transformative journey towards streamlined AI-powered player support.

**Important Note:** Closely monitor the analytics after deployment. These insights will guide you in optimizing Chatform's performance and progressively improving automation rates. Remember, just like any new team member, Chatform will require some time to reach peak proficiency.

**Think of it this way:** You are onboarding Chatform as you would a human agent. Initial training and ongoing coaching are crucial. It's unrealistic to expect flawless performance from the outset. So give Chatform time, keep adding ticket types and fine-tuning the instructions.

Buckle up and prepare to witness the wonders of AI magic automating your ticket handling, freeing your team to focus on more complex issues.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Review initial automation rates and set realistic expectations.** Increasing these rates will be an ongoing process.
* **Identify opportunities for improvement and refine Chatform's performance over time.**
* **Utilize the playground environment for further testing and experimentation.**

With dedication and a focus on continuous improvement, Chatform will become an invaluable asset in your quest for exceptional player support.
