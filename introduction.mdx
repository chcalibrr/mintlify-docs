## AI agents vs (AI) Chatbots

The potential of AI agents is vastly underestimated and often misunderstood. AI agents are not merely better chatbots; they represent a fundamental shift in how brands interact with their players.

#### Traditional Chatbots 

Traditional chatbots operate on a keyword-based system, guiding players through a predefined conversational flow based on specific words or phrases. While these systems can be useful for simple flows, they require significant effort to manually build and maintain these flows. Entire teams are often dedicated to managing complex flows in various geos and languages.

The primary goal of these chatbots is often to deflect and automate a portion of incoming player support tickets, or act as simple routers to direct players to the appropriate support agent. However, in practice, this approach frequently results in player frustration. Players often feel misunderstood and struggle to receive effective support, leading to a negative experiences.

Players interacting with chatbots frequently feel like the brand is distancing itself from them. By the time they reach a human agent, they are often more frustrated than they were at the start of the interaction. Research backs this up: nearly one-third (32 percent) of customers say they rarely or never feel understood by a chatbot, and over 30 percent (30.5%) say a chatbot rarely or never fully answers their questions. More than half (54.5 percent) of consumers say they always or often must request to speak to a human after interacting with a chatbot.
 
The reason for this frustration lies in the limitations of traditional chatbots. They lack the cognitive ability to engage in nuanced, human-like conversations.

Online casino brands often hesitate to implement chatbots due to concerns about their effectiveness, opting instead for human support agents. This choice, however, leads to significant scalability constraints in their high-volume contact centers.

#### AI Chatbots 

AI chatbots represent an improvement over their traditional counterparts, incorporating "intents" along with keyword matching. This allows them to recognize a wider range of player language and interpret meaning beyond literal phrases. However, they still rely on pre-programmed responses and struggle with complex queries.

#### GenerativeAI Chatbots 

Many platforms now offer “generative AI” capabilities for chatbots. This technology allows them to formulate answers on the fly based on a knowledge base or FAQ, much like a sophisticated search engine. While impressive, these capabilities are still limited. While they can effectively answer general brand questions, such as "Where can I see my bonuses," they are unable to address real player issues that require context and deeper cognitive abilities such as "I didn't get my deposit bonus" .

#### Chatforms AI agent

This is where AI agents truly excel. They possess the ability to engage in natural, human-like conversations, understanding the nuances of language and the context of the interaction. Furthermore, they can apply reasoning to solve players issues.

Imagine a player who says they haven't received their withdrawal. An AI agent can access the players data, assess the status of the withdrawal, perhaps they have exceeded the limit of  withdrawals, and determine the appropriate course of action based on brands policies. They might tell the player to check back, they may initiate a back office ticket, or escalate the issue to a human agent, all without requiring a player to navigate through a series of frustrating flows.

AI agents can handle complex, context-dependent tasks that are typically reserved for human agents. They offer a more efficient and personalized experience for players, allowing brands to automate end-to-end support while delivering higher levels of accuracy and satisfaction.
