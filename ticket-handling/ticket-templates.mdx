To streamline your setup process, weâ€™ve developed a comprehensive collection of ticket templates. These templates are designed to help you quickly activate and customize prebuilt instructions for handling various types of support tickets. Our templates are based on extensive research and analysis of the most common customizations and repetitive support ticket types that players frequently reach out for.

In addition to these prebuilt templates, Chatform's intelligent system continuously analyzes the support requests from your players. It automatically identifies and recommends new ticket types for issues that are not currently addressed by your existing templates. This ensures that your support team is always prepared to handle emerging and unique player concerns.

Should you require assistance in building a custom ticket type that you cannot find in our extensive ticket library, please do not hesitate to reach out to your account executive. They are available to help you tailor a solution that meets your specific needs and ensures optimal support for your players.
