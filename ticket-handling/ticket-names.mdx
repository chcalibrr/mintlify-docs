For Chatform to accurately identify the intent behind a player's message and trigger the appropriate ticket handling automation, it's crucial to follow specific guidelines when naming and describing these automations.

## Ticket handling automation names:
The Ticket type name should concisely reflect the player's intent or question. Use specific names that corrolate to what players typically use when making that type of inquiry. This helps Chatform accurately identify the intent behind player messages.

Good examples:
- Check Withdrawal Status
- Check Deposit status

Bad examples: 
- Withdrawals (too vague)
- Deposits (ambiguous)

Descriptions:
Include a description that gives a good understnading of when to trigger the ticket handling instruction it is best to starts with "Assist a player when they are inquiring about...". This gives Chatform explicit context on when to trigger this automation.

For example:
"Assist a player when they are inquiring about the status of their recent withdrawal request."

Rather than:
"Withdrawal issues"

Clear descriptions allow Chatform to better understand the scope of each automation.

By following these naming and description conventions, you enable Chatform to provide more accurate and relevant support to players. If you need any further guidance, please feel free to reach out to your account executive.
