Ticket types are the foundation of Chatformss AI player support platform. They categorize the different inquiries and issues your players might have when reaching out to support.

### What are Ticket Types?

Ticket types are essentially intents that categorize player inquiries based on their nature and content. They help you define handling instructions for each type of support inquiriy that players may reach out to support for, this enables Chatform's AI to automatically route tickets to the appropriate ticket types and handle the support ticket accordingly.

### Creating new Ticket Type

<Tip>**Think Specific, Not Broad**</Tip>

When creating a new ticket type handling instructions. It is recommended to fragment ticket types and not combine all similar types in to one ticket type. instead of generic categories like "Deposit Issues", create **laser-focused** ticket types like:

* "I made a deposit but don't see the money in my account"
* "My deposit is pending for a long time."
* "I'm having trouble making a deposit using [payment method]."

This granular approach allows Chatform to more accurately identify a players intent. Ensuring the AI provides the most relevant response and resolutions. It also ensures that the correct actions are being triggered as part of the specific ticket handling instructions.
