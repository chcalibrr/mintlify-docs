## Built in techniques

At Chatform, our AI cognition engine has been meticulously trained on thousands of iGaming conversations. We employ cutting-edge architectures and continually refine our methods, techniques, and models to deliver the most accurate results possible.

The way you set up your ticket handling instructions plays a crucial role in how the AI cognition engine understands and handles tickets, as the underlying technology relies on a blend of large language models (LLMs). Often, rephrasing the instructions can lead to improved handling results – a process we refer to as "fine-tuning."

## Fine Tuning

To get started, draft initial ticket handling instructions and refine them iteratively. You can gain insights into the AI cognition engine's reasoning and handling processes from the logs. (Advanced logging options are available; reach out to your account executive if you'd like them enabled on your account.)

Behind the scenes, we employ advanced techniques to align our models with accuracy and specificity. However, here are some tips you can use when providing ticket handling instructions to improve results:

## Tips

1. **Be Precise**: Strive for utmost specificity in your instructions. 

2. **Provide examples**: Giving examples in the instructions when requesting a particular task can be highly beneficial. For instance, when instructing the AI engine to check a players bonus balance, consider including an example like:

   ```
   When checking the player's bonus balance, ensure you reference the bonus_balance and not calculate the wallet_balance.

   Example:
   wallet_balance: 100
   bonus_balance: 0
   Would result in a 0 balance.
   ```

   This approach helps the AI engine reason more effectively and ensure accuracy.

2. **Separate Sections**: Use `———` separators to delineate distinct sections within your instructions.

3. **Highlight Importance**: If a particular instruction or point is crucial, preface it with "IMPORTANT:".

4. **Continuous Improvement**: Perhaps most importantly, continuously improve your instructions based on insights gleaned from the reasoning logs. If the results do not align with your intentions, it may be due to unclear instructions that deviate from the AI's expected understanding. Feel free to reach out to your account executive for additional tips and assistance.

By following these best practices, you can optimize the performance of Chatform's AI ticket handling automation, ensuring efficient and accurate support for your iGaming operations.

If your results are not aligning with your expectations, it may be due to unclear instructions. In such cases, don't hesitate to contact your account executive for personalized guidance and support.
