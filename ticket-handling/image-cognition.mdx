Image cognition is a powerful tool in Chatform that allows you to analyze images submitted by players as part of automated ticket handling. This enables more efficient and automated handling of common scenarios where visual proof is often required.

### Use Cases for Image Cognition

**Verifying Deposits**
Players sometimes need to provide proof that they made a deposit, such as a screenshot of their banking transaction or digital wallet. Image cognition can analyze these images to automatically verify if a legitimate deposit matching a certain criteria was made.

**Confirming Wins**
When players claim they hit a big win on a game, you can have them submit a screenshot. Image cognition will review the images to confirm the stated win amount and payout based on the game rules and then handle the ticket accordingly.
